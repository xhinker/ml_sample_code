## What is Tensor

Tensor is a generalization of scalars and vectors. They describe geometric relation between scalar-scalar,scalar-vector,vector-vector and even other tensors. They are generally represented as multi dimensional arrays.Hence we generally deal them with rank of that array/matrix.
• Scalar: Tensor of rank 0. (magnitude only – 1 component)
• Vector: Tensor of rank 1. (magnitude and one direction – 3 components)
• Dyad: Tensor of rank 2. (magnitude and two directions – 32 = 9 components)
• Triad: Tensor of rank 3. (magnitude and three directions – 33 = 27 components)

Ok, think tensor as multi-dimensional array with a bunch of functions,like forward and backward.
